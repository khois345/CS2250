                Egg fried rice, three ingredient, egg, fried and rice and you still mess it up Jamie. Hiya.<br>
                Why does Uncle Rogers say hiya? That's just a slang word, it just mean you're disappointed in something. When things don't go your way, just say hiya. You stub your toe, hiya.

                How to make ramen, Uncle Roger? Ramen, very difficult to make, so don't try at home, just go eat at ramen shop. If you can go to Japan, that even better. 
                Don't make ramen at home, you end up making just some terrible miso paste in boiling water type ramen. 
                That not good. Proper ramen, you need like 12 hour, 18 hour, 24 hour, just to make the broth, so don't even try, just go out and eat.<br>
